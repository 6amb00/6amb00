**The Endless Hills** is a team of visual novel creators from Russia, founded by Bamboo.

It all started back in 2017 when a small group *Warrior Cats* fans got together and decided to make our own game — at the time, there were barely any like it.
Some of us were total beginners — coders, artists — but a few already had some experience. We didn’t do it for profit, we did it because it was fun. Over the years, making games helped us grow as creators, and our stories found hundreds of thousands of players. The mobile versions turned out to be especially popular — simple, accessible, and easy to run on almost any device.
Our last visual novel came out in 2021. After that, each of us moved on — some to new projects, some to new lives. Right now, **The Endless Hills** are dormant. We stopped supporting the apps on Google Play — it takes a lot of effort and isn’t really needed anymore. Maybe one day we’ll come back. No promises, though.
Here on this site, you can still find and download all our old visual novels.

Thank you to everyone who ever joined us in creating and testing these games:
