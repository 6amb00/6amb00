## Hey everyone, it’s Bamboo here.
I’ve launched this new site to replace the old one (theendlesshills.com). The old domain expired ages ago and someone else snatched it up, so now we have a new home.
Here you’ll find Google Drive links to safely download all our old projects — no worries, no viruses. That’s the practical part done. Now for the lyrical bit, for anyone wondering where we disappeared to.

## **A little backstory**

I haven’t touched The Endless Hills in a long time. Not because I got bored — life just threw too much at me. At some point it felt like I’d landed in a Netflix series where something impossible happens in every episode. Trust me, if you knew half of it, you’d be shocked too. My health also went downhill, so whatever energy I had left went to things that really mattered — hobbies had to wait.
I could’ve just left the old site up and paid for hosting. That’s what I did for a while, until one of the former team members talked me into moving everything to free GitHub Pages to save money. He started migrating the site but never finished it — and didn’t leave any instructions either. So everything just froze for a long time. When I finally had the chance, I figured it out on my own and finished what he didn’t. If you’re reading this, it means it worked.
I’m still amazed that people keep googling our games and even download them from shady sites (please don’t — it’s risky). That’s one of the big reasons I wanted to bring the official site back. I’m endlessly grateful to everyone who still remembers and loves our amateur visual novels — made long before the AI era. Every picture, every line of code, every note of music — all done by real people.
I won’t say AI has killed art — but the game sure has changed, hasn’t it?

So, what’s next? Honestly — I don’t know. If life gives me some breathing room, maybe I’ll make something new. As for the rest of the old crew... some moved abroad, some just vanished into the woods and turned off their phones. If there’s ever a new project, it might be with new people.
Either way, I’ll be keeping an eye on this site — so our old games stay available for anyone who wants them.
Thanks to everyone who’s still here. And if you ever want to say hi — you know where to find me.
